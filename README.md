 Suilance: Create Bounty Module

The `create_bounty` module is a smart contract written for suilance that enables projects to create and manage prize bounties. It ensures that the total prize pool is securely locked upfront and transparently disbursed to winners subsequently automatically, 

Features

- Bounty Creation: Define prize distributions and lock corresponding SUI funds in a single transaction.
- Transparent Prize Allocation: Clearly specify prizes for each rank (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd places).
- Automatic Validation: Ensures the total prize amount matches the locked funds before allowing bounty creation.
- Subsequently more commits will be put forward that aid automatic disbursment of funds
